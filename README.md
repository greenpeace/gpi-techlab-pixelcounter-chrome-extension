URL Shortener
The URL Shortener is a feature that allows for the shortening of the URL, not the domain name, and there are two options for shortening - you can choose your short name or let the system generate a short random name.

If you want to take full advantage of the URL shortener, you can create links that give you access quickly. To make this work, you must download the Chrome Extension https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/greenpeace-links/fmjaadnmblikopcipldjipafkbhhlkog

When the extension is installed, you can use it in your chrome browser to access the links you setup by entering: gp/<link>. 

What is a gp link
A gp/<link> is a short link so that somebody can type a short, memorable link such as gp/mail rather than a hard-to-remember link into their browser.

The user's browser uses the chrome extension to resolve the link to greenpeace.org servers. The server then redirects the browser to the full URL.
